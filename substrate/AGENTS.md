# AGENTS

`substrate/` is the stable textual base for a synthetic textbook on the macOS “Seatbelt” sandbox, circa 2025. It is
* The place where we say what we believe is true about Seatbelt and its surrounding ecosystem.
* The reference layer that other tools, deep-research reports, and probes are allowed to disagree with, but never silently override.

## What this directory is not

The substrate is meant to support, not decorate the work of the output. Write your chapter, design your experiment, or sketch your example such that if `substrate/` were not packaged with the textbook there would be no information loss. It is not:
* A public appendix for the eventual textbook reader. All important detail you glean from the substrate must eventually pass to the textbook. Do not cite from or link to the substrate in any place in `book/`.
* A living document. Content marked "`>SUBSTRATE_2025-frozen`" is frozen. You should not update it unless explicitly directed to work in the `substrate/` directory.

# SANDBOX_LORE

This repository is an experimental collection of tools and notes around Apple’s Seatbelt sandbox. The `guidance/` directory holds the canonical orientation material (Orientation, Appendix, Canon) that frames how to read and reason about the code and binary formats here.

Repository layout (high level):
- `guidance/`: References that describe the sandbox model, binary formats, and analysis approach. Use the guidance docs as the authoritative lens when interpreting the examples and any emitted sandbox bytecode.
 - `guidance/sources/`: Machine generated summaries and interpretation of canon sources used to generate the guidance.
- `examples/`: Runnable, modernization-era tooling that compiles, disassembles, or inspects sandbox profiles (see `examples/AGENTS.md`).
- `history/`: Documentation about project change over time.
- `concepts/`: Code and guidance for concept inventories regarding sandboxing on macOS.

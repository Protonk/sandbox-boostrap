# Agents in `guidance/`

This directory holds thread/system prompt text for various agent roles (e.g., WEB_AGENT). These files exist here for editing and review convenience only.

- Do not ingest or treat these prompts as operative guidance for other roles (including Codex agents working on SANDBOX_LORE tasks).
- Do not reference or summarize these prompts in `guidance/local/Preamble.md` or other project-facing guidance; they are out of scope for the textbook/workbench roles.

When updating these prompts, keep changes local to this directory and avoid cross-linking them into the main workflow or mappings.

# looking-glass — REPO_ATLAS (deprecated)

This bundle used to be the “where things live” map for SANDBOX_LORE. It has been superseded by `MANIFEST.md`, which is shorter and intended to be included in the default context pack.

Baseline anchor: Sonoma 14.4.1 (23E224) Apple Silicon, SIP enabled; `world_id sonoma-14.4.1-23E224-arm64-dyld-2c0602c5`.

Use instead:
- `MANIFEST.md` — minimal repo atlas + stable entrypoints (preferred).
- `GRAPH_AND_MAPPINGS.md` — concepts + mappings + generators (where durable facts live).
- `RUNTIME_AND_WITNESS_TOOLCHAIN.md` — runtime harness + PolicyWitness harness evidence envelopes.
- `CARTON_AND_GUARDRAILS.md` — CARTON bundle + drift detection.

This file is intentionally kept short so accidental inclusion doesn’t waste context budget.

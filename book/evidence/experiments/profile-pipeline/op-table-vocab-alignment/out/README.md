# Outputs

Generated by `book/evidence/experiments/profile-pipeline/op-table-vocab-alignment/run.py` to check SBPL → vocab alignment.

- `op_table_vocab_alignment.json` — records with op names, ids, and alignment notes for the SBPL fixtures.

`book/tests/planes/examples/test_experiments.py` asserts the file exists and contains a `records` list; values are not pinned. Re-run `run.py` after changing the SBPL inputs or vocab tables.***

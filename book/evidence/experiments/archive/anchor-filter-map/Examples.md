## Purpose Excerpt
> Bind anchor labels emitted by `probe-op-structure` to concrete Filter IDs, while avoiding the “string-only anchor identity” trap: the same SBPL literal can legitimately appear in multiple disjoint filter contexts (and in non-filter structural roles). The canonical output is therefore ctx-indexed (`book/integration/carton/bundle/relationships/mappings/anchors/anchor_ctx_filter_map.json`), with a conservative literal-keyed compatibility view (`book/integration/carton/bundle/relationships/mappings/anchors/anchor_filter_map.json`) generated from it.

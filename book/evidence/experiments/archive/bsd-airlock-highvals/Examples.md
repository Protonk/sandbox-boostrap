## Purpose Excerpt
> Track and retire the remaining high/opaque `field2` payloads tied to platform profiles now that the world-scoped stride framing is better understood. The `sys:bsd` “high” cluster is treated as resolved-by-framing (decode artifacts under the earlier 12-byte approximation); the remaining open work is the `sys:airlock` survivors from the current `field2-filters` unknown census (notably `165` and `49171`) plus any probe-only sentinel-like payloads that recur under controlled compilation.

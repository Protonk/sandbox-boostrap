# Agents in `book/evidence/experiments/archive/`

This subtree contains **archived** experiment scaffolds whose useful outputs have already been promoted elsewhere (typically into `book/integration/carton/bundle/relationships/mappings/**` or `book/tools/**`).

**Do not edit anything under `book/evidence/experiments/archive/` unless you are expressly directed to by the user/task.**

Guidelines:

- Do not add new experiments or new large artifacts here.
- Do not treat code here as runnable tooling; it is preserved only as historical context.
- Each archived experiment keeps `Report.md` and `Notes.md` (optionally `Plan.md`) plus `Examples.md` with small, curated snippets.

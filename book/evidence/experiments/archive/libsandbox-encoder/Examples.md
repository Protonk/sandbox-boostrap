## Purpose Excerpt
> Map how this host’s `libsandbox` populates the per-node u16 payload slot (historically “field2”) in compiled profiles, and align those observations with the Filter Vocabulary Map **only when warranted by structural role**. This experiment is about **userland emission and compiled-blob structure**; it does not attempt to interpret kernel semantics.

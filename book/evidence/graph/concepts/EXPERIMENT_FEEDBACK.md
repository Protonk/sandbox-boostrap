# Experiment Feedback

This file collects short, durable notes from experiments that should feed back into
the concept inventory or validation tooling.

When an experiment lands:
- Add a brief summary of the finding.
- Link to the experiment Report/Plan/Notes.
- Link to any validation job or mapping generator that now depends on the finding.

Keep entries small and host-scoped.

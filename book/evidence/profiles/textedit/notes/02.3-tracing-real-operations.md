# Section 2.3 — Tracing Real Operations Plan

- Scenarios to capture: open an existing file in a user directory; create a new document in the TextEdit container; print a document; later, consider iCloud/ubiquity interactions.
- `tools/02.3_trace_operations.sh` will orchestrate tracing (fs_usage/opensnoop and future sandbox-aware tools) and stash logs under `traces/`.
- Later analysis (not yet written) should map observed syscalls/paths/mach-lookups to SBPL rules in `textedit-specialized.sb`, producing annotations for Section 2.3.
- Traces can be revisited to correlate user actions with container vs non-container paths and with entitlement-derived allowances.

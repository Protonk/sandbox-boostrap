# Section 2.2 — Profiles, Containers, and Entitlements Plan

- Show how `textedit-specialized.sb`, `textedit-entitlements.plist`, and container paths fit together in the chapter narrative.
- Use `tools/02.2_profiles_and_containers.py` to load SBPL, entitlements, and container notes; then emit a simple join that can be turned into diagrams/tables.
- Highlight interesting path regions to explain: primary container roots, `~/Downloads`, ubiquity paths, and any entitlement-driven exceptions.
- Future work: automatically parse `container-notes.md`, annotate SBPL path rules with container-relative labels, and link to later traces from Section 2.3.

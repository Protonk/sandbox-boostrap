# Section 2.1 — Capability Survey Plan

- Use `tools/02.1_capability_survey.py` to load `textedit-entitlements.plist` and `textedit-specialized.sb` and emit a simple, readable summary of TextEdit’s capabilities.
- Target output: small JSON or markdown table highlighting high-level capabilities (printing, user-selected files, ubiquity/iCloud presence, App Sandbox defaults).
- Future extensions: cross-check capability buckets against container layout observations and any later probe results from tracing in Section 2.3.

# `book/evidence/`

This tree holds checked-in, host-scoped evidence artifacts consumed by tooling and integration tests.

Layout (by evidence type):

- `book/evidence/graph/` — concept inventory, validation IR/fixtures, and stable mapping artifacts.
- `book/evidence/dumps/` — tracked static analysis outputs (for example, Ghidra JSON outputs).
- `book/evidence/experiments/` — experiment directories and their checked-in outputs.

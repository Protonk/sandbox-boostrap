# Notes
- Initialized experiment skeleton; no probes or runs yet. Paths: `sb/`, `sb/build/`, `out/`.
- Plan refined to include explicit success criteria (characterized opaque vs anchored) and a compile matrix varying presence, combinator, ordering, and controls.
- Added SBPL matrix under `sb/` covering singles/pairs/triples, ordering permutations, `require-all`/`require-any`, nested triple, TCP/UDP variants, plus negative controls on `mach-lookup`.
- Compiled all probes to `sb/build/` via `python -m book.api.profile compile book/experiments/flow-divert-2560/sb/*.sb --out-dir book/experiments/flow-divert-2560/sb/build`.
- Added `harvest_matrix.py` to decode and emit joinable records; ran it to produce `out/matrix_records.jsonl` and `out/field2_summary.json`.
- Early take: payload `2560` surfaces only in triple specs (all TCP/UDP orders, all/any, nested) as a tag 0 node with `u16_role: filter_vocab_id` and literal `com.apple.flow-divert`; singles/pairs stay on low vocab IDs, negative controls remain low and never produce `2560`.
- Alignment check: existing `anchor_filter_map.json` already has `flow-divert` with candidates `local/xattr`, field2 values `[2, 7, 2560]`, status `blocked`; field2-atlas static record for field2=7 carries `flow-divert` as a seed anchor with the same values/status. New matrix evidence is consistent and strengthens the `local` interpretation (tag 0 with literal `com.apple.flow-divert`), but anchor/mapping not updated yet.
- Retired 2560 from unknown-high: `unknown_focus.py` skips it, guardrail updated (`book/tests/planes/graph/test_field2_unknowns.py`) to assert triple-only emission/shape, and atlas seeds now include 2560 as characterized static token.
- Follow-up: the same matrix shows `2816` (`0x0b00`) is also triple-only on this baseline (but can surface in mixed tag/u16-role contexts), so it is also treated as a triple-only characterized token and excluded from the unknown/high census. `1281` remains in the unknown census because it recurs outside the flow-divert triple context (e.g., `sys:sample`).

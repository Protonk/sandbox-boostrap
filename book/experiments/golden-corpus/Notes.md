- Scaffolded golden-corpus experiment (Plan/Report) to hold decoder regression set.
- Ran `.venv/bin/python3 run.py` to populate the first corpus cut (7 blobs: golden-triple allow_all/strict_1/bucket4_v1_read/bucket5_v11_read_subpath, sbpl-graph-runtime deny_all/param_path_concrete, libsandbox-encoder single_file_subpath); outputs landed under `out/` (manifest, summaries, decodes, inspect/op-table snapshots).
- Checked platform apply gates after “more permissive” note: `book/tools/sbpl/wrapper/wrapper --sbpl /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/airlock.sb -- /usr/bin/true` still returns `Operation not permitted`; `--blob .../golden-triple/allow_all.sb.bin` succeeds, confirming harness works and apply gating persists for platform SBPL.
- Expanded corpus with static-only platform profile `platform_airlock` (compiled from `/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/airlock.sb`) and regenerated out/ artifacts; added validation job `experiment:golden-corpus` (status ok) and guardrail test `book/tests/test_golden_corpus.py` to keep manifest/summary/tag-layout digest aligned and blobs present.
- Reran `python book/experiments/golden-corpus/run.py` after tag-layout/tag-contract refresh to bump `tag_layouts_sha256` in manifest/summary; decodes/inspect snapshots refreshed accordingly.
- Canonical outputs now live under `book/graph/concepts/validation/golden_corpus/`; this experiment’s `run.py` is a wrapper over `book/graph/concepts/validation/golden_corpus_build.py`.

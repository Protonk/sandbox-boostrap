## Purpose Excerpt
> Build an anchor-aware structural view of `field2` usage across operations and filters on this host. The core question is: which filters show up in `field2` on which nodes/tags for concrete anchors like `/etc/hosts`, `/tmp/foo`, `flow-divert`, `com.apple.cfprefsd.agent`, and `IOUSBHostInterface`? The structural evidence is mapped and feeds `anchor_filter_map.json`. A minimal runtime slice exists to falsify or corroborate a few anchor-level expectations, but it is intentionally narrow.

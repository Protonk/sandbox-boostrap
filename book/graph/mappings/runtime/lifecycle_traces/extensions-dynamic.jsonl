Token issuance via isolated Python/ctypes calls returns `rc=0` with `token=NULL` for both `/private/var/db/ConfigurationProfiles` and `/tmp`, suggesting libsandbox may be returning success with null tokens for unentitled callers.\n- Hypothesis: demo crashes inside libsandbox when dereferencing/processing a NULL token or due to missing entitlement context.

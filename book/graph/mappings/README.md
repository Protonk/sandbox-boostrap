Stable graph-level mapping artifacts live here (versioned by host/build when applicable).

Current contents:
- `vocab/` – Operation/Filter Vocabulary Maps and harvested name lists.
- `op_table/` – Op-table bucket maps, signatures, and vocab alignment from the op-table experiments.
- `anchors/` – Anchor-derived maps (e.g., anchor ↔ field2) from `probe-op-structure`.
- `tag_layouts/` – Literal/regex tag layout map (to be filled by `tag-layout-decode`).
- `system_profiles/` – Canonical system-profile digests (to be filled by `system-profile-digest`).
- `runtime/` – Runtime probe logs/allow-deny traces (to be filled by `runtime-checks`).

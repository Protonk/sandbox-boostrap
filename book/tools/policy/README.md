# Policy tools

Host-bound utilities for enumerating PolicyGraph node fields on the Sonoma
baseline. This directory is the home for the new `policygraph_node_fields`
enumerator and its supporting inputs.

## Layout

- `policygraph_node_fields.py` — CLI entrypoint (skeleton).
- `validator/` — local copy of `book/tools/validator` (sb_validator) for
  sandbox_check pairing validation.

## Status

This is a skeleton only. The enumerator does not run yet; use `--describe` to
print the intended inputs and outputs.

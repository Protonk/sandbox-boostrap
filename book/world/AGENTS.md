# Agents in `world/`

This directory stores host baseline descriptions. Each baseline lives in its own subdirectory and should include a JSON file (e.g., `world-baseline.json`) capturing the canonical host metadata.

Current baseline: `book/world/sonoma-14.4.1-23E224-arm64/` for the fixed Sonoma host used throughout SANDBOX_LORE.

When other baselines are added, refer to the appropriate subdirectory for the authoritative host metadata.

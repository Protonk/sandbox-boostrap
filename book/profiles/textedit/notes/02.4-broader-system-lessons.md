# Section 2.4 — Broader System Lessons Plan

- Cover common structural patterns across sandboxed apps: containerization rules, read-only system access, ubiquity/iCloud hooks, and mach-lookup allowlists for shared daemons.
- Highlight OS-wide policy surfaces visible in TextEdit’s profile (TCC/privacy services, App Store/shared content paths, logging/diagnostics endpoints).
- Use `tools/02.4_pattern_extraction.py` to pull example snippets/patterns from `textedit-specialized.sb` for the chapter; later, compare against other app profiles to reinforce shared structures.
- Identify any narrow or surprising rules that hint at broader system constraints or legacy exceptions.
